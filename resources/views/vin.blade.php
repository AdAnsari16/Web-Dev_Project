		<h1>VINYASA YOGA</h1>


	<p class="text-justify">
    Vinyasa is a style of yoga characterized by stringing postures together so that you move from one to another, seamlessly, using breath.  Commonly referred to as “flow” yoga, it is sometimes confused with “power yoga“.<br>

  Vinyasa classes offer a variety of postures and no two classes are ever alike.  The opposite would be “fixed forms” such as Bikram Yoga, which features the same 26 postures in every class, or Ashtanga which has the same sequence every time.<br>

  The variable nature of Vinyasa Yoga helps to develop a more balanced body as well as prevent repetitive motion injuries that can happen if you are always doing the same thing every day.<br>

  As a philosophy, Vinyasa recognizes the temporary nature of things.  We enter into a posture, are there for a while and then leave.<br>

  While Vinyasa, or Vinyasa-Krama, dates back to the Vedic age—the earliest period of yoga thousands of years ago—it referred to a series, or sequence of steps, to make something sacred.<br>

  The movement practice of Vinyasa is said to begin with T Krishnamacharya who has had the largest influence on how yoga, in general, is practiced today.<br>

  Put all this together and Vinyasa, is a breath initiated practice, that connects every action of our life with the intention of moving towards what is sacred, or most important to us.While Vinyasa Yoga is one of the most popular forms of the practice in the world today, it is not well understood.<br>

<h2>Characteristics of Vinyasa Flow Yoga</h2>

<p class="text-justify">
  Vinyasa Yoga connects one posture to the next using the breath.  This can be thought of as linking or flowing into postures which is sometimes why it’s called “Flow Yoga”.  The opposite of this would be an alignment based class where students engage with a posture, explore it for a period of time and then “break the posture” by coming out.<br>
  “Transitions” are what connect one posture to another in Vinyasa.  They are the in-between part.  What is not always appreciated is that transitions are considered postures themselves.  To move in a more graceful, connected way, allot just as much time developing skill in the transitions as you do in the asana.<br>
  Vinyasa is synonymous with movement.  Moving in and out of postures is the obvious movement but even in stillness Vinyasa is represented by the beat of your heart and inhale/exhale of your breath.<br>
  Move with breath.  Breath initiates the movement of Vinyasa which is why you’ll hear it referred to as a “breath-synchronized” practice.<br>
  Ujjayi Breath is the breathing technique used.  It is done by inhaling and exhaling in a rhythmic manner through the nose.  The overall sensation is one of relaxation.<br>
  Vinyasa practice generates heat and can add a cardiovascular component not always present in other forms of postural practice.  The picture below is from a student’s heart rate monitor worn during a regular Vinyasa class I taught.

<h2>Why Vinyasa Yoga is So Popular</h2>

<p class="text-justify">
1. Vinyasa doesn’t take long to learn to teach initially.  It does take time and effort to learn to teach well. <br>
2. Vinyasa yoga is athletic and aerobic. People want to move and sweat and Vinyasa provide that.<br>
3.3. Vinyasa yoga is fun.
