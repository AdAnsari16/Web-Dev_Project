      <p>Let’s face it — there’s an overwhelming amount of information on the Internet about how to quickly shed pounds and get in shape.
   If you’re looking for the best tips on how to lose weight and keep it off, this seemingly endless amount of advice can be overwhelming and confusing.
   </p><p>From the diets promoting raw foods to meal plans that revolve around shakes and prepackaged foods, a new fad diet seems to pop up every day.
   The problem is, although very restrictive diets and elimination meal plans will most likely result in short-term weight loss, most people can’t maintain them and end up throwing in the towel within a few weeks.
   Although losing 10 pounds (4.5 kg) in a week by following a fad diet may seem tempting, the reality is that this type of weight loss is often unhealthy and unsustainable.
   </p>
   <p>
   The real key to safe and successful weight loss is to adopt a healthy lifestyle that suits your individual needs and that you can maintain for life

            <p><b>Protein sources</b>: Tofu, legumes, dairy, nuts and seeds
            Meals and snacks should focus on fresh, whole foods flavored with herbs and spices.
            
            <p>Additionally, adding non-starchy vegetables like greens, eggplants or tomatoes to your meals will provide a boost of fiber that can help you feel satisfied for a longer period of time after eating.</p>
            <b>What to Drink</b>
              <p>An easy way to cut back on excess calories and sugar is to avoid sugar-sweetened beverages and juices. These drinks can be high in both calories and sugar, which can negatively affect weight loss.

             <h4>Healthy beverage options include:</h4>

Water
Sparkling water
Unsweetened tea including Darjeeling, Assam and Nilgiri teas
SUMMARY
A healthy Indian diet should focus on fresh ingredients such as vegetables, fruits, tubers, legumes, whole grains, healthy fats and unsweetened beverages.

<h4>Unhealthy Foods to Avoid</h4>
Choosing foods and beverages that are highly processed, loaded with sugar or high in calories can sabotage your weight loss efforts.

Not only are items like candy, fried foods and soda not good for weight loss — they aren't good for overall health.

Eating too much processed food and products laden with sweeteners can increase the risk of chronic diseases.

For example, drinking sugar-sweetened beverages like soda, fruit punch and juices every day has been associated with increased risks of diabetes, obesity and heart disease (11Trusted Source).

Plus, consuming unhealthy foods can make it harder for you to lose fat and maintain a healthy weight.  
   
<p>For optimal health, minimize the following foods or avoid them altogether:

<p><b>Sweetened beverages</b>>: Soda, fruit juice, sweetened tea, sweet lassi, sports drinks
<p><b>High-sugar foods</b>: Candy, ice cream, cookies, rice pudding, pastries, cakes, sweetened yogurt, high-sugar cereals, digestive biscuits
Jaggery, sugar, honey, condensed milk
<p><b> Sweetened sauces</b>: Salad dressings with added sugar, ketchup, barbecue sauce, sweetened curries
  <p><b> High-fat foods</b>: Fast food like McDonald’s, french fries, chips, fried foods, bhujia
  <p><b> Refined grains</b>: Products including white bread, white pasta, biscuits
<p><b>Trans fats</b>: Margarine, vanaspati, fast food, highly processed foods
  <p><b>Refined oils</b>: Canola oil, soybean oil, corn oil, grapeseed oil
<p>Although it’s perfectly fine to enjoy an occasional treat, limiting the foods and beverages listed above is best for overall health.

<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
<p>Avoiding sweetened beverages, fast food, fried items and products high in added sugar can help you lose weight and get healthier.
