		<h1>POWER YOGA</h1>


	<p class="text-justify">
    The term "power yoga" became popular during the mid-1990s when two American yoga teachers who had studied with Ashtanga guru Sri K. Pattabhi Jois began to make what they had learned more accessible to Western students. They also wanted to move away from the rigid Ashtanga sequence, which is a set series of poses that are always done in the same order.<BR>

  Bryan Kest, based in Los Angeles, and Beryl Bender Birch, based in New York, are most often credited with the nearly simultaneous invention of power yoga on opposite coasts. Both were part of the second generation of American Ashtanga students; Kest originally learned from David Williams and Bender Birth from yoga guru Norman Allen. Williams and Allen were both among Jois's first western students. Kest went on to study with Jois in Mysore, India. Bender Birch, who had previously done Sivananda, Kundalini, and Iyengar yoga, worked with Jois during his trips to the United States in the 1980s.<br>
  Power yoga is a general term used to describe a vigorous, fitness-based approach to vinyasa-style yoga. Though many consider power yoga to be superficial "gym yoga," this style of yoga practice was originally closely modeled on the Ashtanga method.<br>

<h2>Style</h2>

<p class="text-justify">
	One of the biggest hurdles to starting yoga is figuring out what style of yoga you want to try. It's often confusing for beginners because the class names and options are so broad. While almost all styles use the same physical postures, each has a particular emphasis. This cheat sheet highlights the differences so you can determine which type is most appealing to you.<br>
Aside from classes designated as "beginner yoga," generally speaking, classes labeled as "hatha" are slower-moving, thoughtful practices that focus on basic, beginner-friendly poses.2﻿ Of course, it's important to recognize that the term "hatha" is actually a generic designation for any form of yoga focused on movement. In America, almost every yoga class is, technically, hatha, so make sure you ask the instructor what you can expect before your first class.<br>

<h2>Avoid Power Yoga If:</h2>

<p class="text-justify">
  1. You aren’t in good shape. Power yoga, at a minimum, requires you to be moderately fit—otherwise, the physically intensive asanas (poses) can end up doing more harm than good.<br>
  2. You are pregnant. Certain asanas can potentially cause complications during pregnancy. (Instead, try prenatal yoga classes, which are gentle and designed for pregnant women.)<br>
  3. You suffer from a chronic physical ailment such as diabetes or arthritis<br>
